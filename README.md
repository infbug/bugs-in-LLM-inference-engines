## 📦 About This Repository

This repository contains the dataset and supplementary materials for the TOSEM paper
**“A First Look at Bugs in LLM Inference Engines.”**

We systematically studied **929 real-world bugs** collected from **five widely used LLM inference engines**, analyzed their root causes, symptoms, and impacts, and derived actionable insights for improving the reliability of LLM inference systems.

The resources in this repository are intended to support **reproducibility** and **future research** on LLM inference engine reliability.
